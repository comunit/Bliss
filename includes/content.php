			<div class="about">
				<h2>The trends in apparel vary throughout the seasons, with the choice of material and colors. Clothes manufacturers often keep a basic line available and offer a seasonal line in the spring and fall. With the latest in technology, it is possible to work with an apparel manufacturer from overseas and add new and appealing clothing that differs from the standard lines. 
APPAREL MANUFACTURER UK LTD is a clothing manufacturer which will work with your designers to provide you with a low-cost source for your own brand of APPAREL. This means you choose the material, color and design for apparel you offer in your retail business. You are no longer limited to the clothes that manufacturers offer in a catalog. You have the opportunity to create your own private label and store catalog. 
You may prefer to buy from an overseas clothing manufacturer and need an agent to inspect the apparel before shipping. We will arrange a meeting with the apparel manufacturer to determine the quality of the clothing and pass the report on to you. You can buy in confidence, knowing the product is of good quality and void of defects. 
The advantages of working with our staff puts you ahead of the fashion game in apparel. Whether you run a mail order company or have a retail store front at the mall, we provide you with the necessary tools to view the new clothing manufacturer lines and choose which cloths will sell in your market.
